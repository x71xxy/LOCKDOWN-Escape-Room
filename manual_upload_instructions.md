# Manual Upload Instructions for Large Model Files

There seem to be connection issues when trying to push the large model files to GitHub. Here are instructions to manually upload your models:

## Option 1: Git LFS (Preferred)

1. Make sure Git LFS is installed:
   ```
   git lfs install
   ```

2. Try pushing at a later time when your internet connection might be more stable:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Manual Upload through GitHub Web Interface

1. Open your GitHub repository in a browser:
   https://github.com/x71xxy/LOCKDOWN-Escape-Room

2. Navigate to the models/treasurechest folder on GitHub (create it if it doesn't exist)

3. Click the "Add file" button and select "Upload files"

4. Drag and drop your treasure_chest.glb file or browse to select it

5. Add a commit message like "Add treasure chest model"

6. Click "Commit changes"

## Option 3: Use Alternative Storage

If GitHub continues to have issues with large files:

1. Upload your model files to a cloud storage service like:
   - Google Drive
   - Dropbox
   - Microsoft OneDrive

2. Update your code to load models from these external URLs instead of local files:

```javascript
// Example change in main.js
loader.load('https://your-cloud-storage-url.com/treasure_chest.glb', function(gltf) {
    treasurechestModel = gltf.scene;
    // rest of the code...
});
```

## Current Project Status

The code has been successfully updated to use the treasure chest model. The only remaining issue is getting the large model file uploaded to GitHub.

Once you've uploaded the model file using one of the methods above, the project will be fully functional.
