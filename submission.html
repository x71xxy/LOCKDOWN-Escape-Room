              <p><strong>Name:</strong> Xyi XIong</p>
              <p><strong>Student ID:</strong> 279069</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              LOCKDOWN is a web-based escape room 3D experience built with
              Three.js. Players must solve three different puzzles to complete
              the escape.
            </p>

            <h3>Development Purpose</h3>
            <p>
              This project showcases the capabilities of Web 3D technology,
              particularly in interactive experience design. By integrating
              HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and 3D technologies, I've created an
              immersive user experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
            <p>
              The project uses Three.js for 3D rendering, GSAP for animation
              effects, and JavaScript for interactive functionality. The page
              design employs responsive layout, adapting to different device
              sizes.
            </p>

            <h3>Development Process</h3>
            <p>
              This project was developed as an extension of the concepts learned
              in the laboratory sessions, but with significant original
              additions and creative direction:
            </p>
            <ul class="development-process">
              <li>
                <strong>Original Theme and Concept:</strong> Instead of
                following the Coca-Cola theme from lab work, I created an escape
                room experience with unique puzzle mechanics. This decision was
                made to create a more engaging and interactive experience that
                would better showcase my skills in 3D modeling and JavaScript
                interactivity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Enhanced 3D Modeling:</strong> Created three detailed 3D
                models (Treasure Chest, Sequence Switches, and Directional
                Puzzle) with complex geometries, advanced materials, and custom
                animations. I deliberately chose models with varying complexity
                levels to demonstrate a range of 3D modeling techniques.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Expanded Interactivity:</strong> Implemented advanced
                JavaScript for multiple interaction types, including password
                entry, sequence matching, and puzzle rotation mechanics. Each
                interaction type demonstrates a different aspect of
                JavaScript-to-3D integration capabilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Custom Lighting System:</strong> Designed a dynamic
                lighting system with intensity controls beyond what was covered
                in the labs. This enhances the atmospheric effect of the escape
                room and showcases technical understanding of Three.js lighting.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Original UI Design:</strong> Created a custom user
                interface with a dark theme and responsive layout designed
                specifically for the escape room concept. The dark theme was
                chosen to enhance the immersive experience while improving
                visual contrast for interactive elements.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Challenges &amp; Solutions</h3>
            <p>
              During development, several technical challenges were encountered
              and solved:
            </p>
            <ul class="technical-challenges">
              <li>
                <strong>3D Model Integration:</strong> Creating seamless
                integration between 3D models and HTML/CSS interface required
                careful management of event listeners and raycasting techniques
                to detect user interactions with specific model parts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Animation Synchronization:</strong> Synchronizing sound
                effects with animations required creating custom event systems
                to ensure timing precision and appropriate user feedback.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Responsive 3D Rendering:</strong> Maintaining
                performance across different device sizes required implementing
                dynamic camera positioning and adaptive rendering quality.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Model Complexity Management:</strong> Balancing model
                detail with performance led to implementing level-of-detail
                adjustments based on user interactions and viewing distance.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
            <p>
              Several optimization techniques were implemented to ensure smooth
              performance:
            </p>
            <ul class="optimization-techniques">
              <li>
                <strong>Model Geometry Optimization:</strong> Reduced polygon
                counts on non-essential model parts while maintaining detail on
                focal interaction points.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Texture Compression:</strong> Implemented efficient
                texture compression to reduce loading times without sacrificing
                visual quality.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Code Efficiency:</strong> Used object pooling for
                particles and optimized render loops to maintain high frame
                rates during complex animations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Asset Loading Strategy:</strong> Implemented progressive
                loading of assets to ensure users can begin interacting while
                heavier resources continue loading.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Memory Management:</strong> Carefully disposed of unused
                3D objects and textures to prevent memory leaks during extended
                sessions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3D Model Source Files</h3>
